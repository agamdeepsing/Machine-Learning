data collection ,data preparation, selecting model with best accuracy, training testing, evaluating, parameter tuning , prediction


# Ques 2
numerical data, timeseries data , categoriacal data.


...numerical data further divided into two 

1. continuous - height weight salary(has any value witin the range)
2. discrete - total students(it has distinct values)


...categorical - it represents position of each player. it takes numericla value 
we can use any number and associate that number to that color.


Time series data:  is a sequence of numbers collected at regular intervals over some period of time.
it is important in the field of finance.



# Ques 3
1.numeric are also known as quantitaive or continuous variables which represents numerical values that can be counted.ex - heght weight age income temp. it is of two types
discrete or comtinuous. it allows us to do numeric opereations such as div add sub mul and many more.

while categorical is known as qualitative and nominal variables. it ususally represents labels categories qualituies. ex male or female colour, qualification. 
Categorical attributes are represented by labels or categories rather than numerical values. it does not allow mathematical operations. it is visualised over bar chart pie chart.


2.Selection of features On the other hand, you just choose a subset of the original feature set without modifying the data.

Dimensionality reduction is often defined as selecting a new representation that can explain most but not all of the variation in your data, maintaining the important information but lowering the amount of information required to express it.




# Ques 4
the histogram is the graphical representation of distribution of a dataset.it shows the freq count of data of different interval, which is also
called as bins . it includes x asis, y axis, bins, bar height, bar width.it is used to visualize the shape and central tendenct (mean median mode).
it is most commonly used in data analysis and statistics.


scatter plot is used to visualize the relationship between two variables. it is represented with dots i.e comapring x axis and ay axis values and plot it with dots.
They are valuable for understanding the direction, strength, and nature of relationships between variables.


# Ques 5
Investigating data is necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns, relationships, and insights that the data holds.
1. detecting errors and outliers understanding distributions  and patterns supporting decision making.

Regarding the discrepancy in exploring qualitative and quantitative data, Qualitative data exploration,
Quantitative data exploration,


# Ques6
1. uniform histogram 
2. symmetric histogram
3. probaility histogram
4. bimodal histogram

bins are used to give spacing on the x axis. bins are created to simplify the data and make it manageable. it is also important to consider the range and distribution of data. 


# Ques 7
we can use z-score for dealing with outliers.
identify and understand the outliers, keep the outliers , remove the outliers, transform the data.                                 


# QUes 8
there are three types of central inclination measures i.e mean median mode.The mean and median can vary significantly in certain datasets due to the presence of outliers. 
when there is outlier they have an impact on mean while no impact on median.


# Ques 9
it uses dots to represents the values for two different values,position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. 
So this visualization gives us the idea of bivariate relationship.

Scatter plot can also help finding outliers as outliers can be visualized at farther distance than regular data.


# Ques 10
it is used to analyze the relationship between two variables.it gives us the way to summarize and analyze by creating contigencytable.
it allows us to make informed decisions influencing the relationship.
